## Who am I ?
I am a young Android developer based in Guangzhou, China. I majored in Microelectronics in [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2012/en/index.htm) in Guangzhou, but fell in love with Software engineering. 

When it comes to coding, I am totally in.

## Why this blog ?
I build up this website to post everything about Software Development during learning, especially about Android. Meanwhile I would like to post some photos and designs of mine in the near future. It takes time but I will implement it somehow.

## Interested ?
If you are in Github, you can check this website project [here](https://github.com/mindjet/mindjet.github.io). It's source open and you're welcome to fork or star it.
